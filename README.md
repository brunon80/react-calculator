## Todo
- Create Enums for operators and special keys
- Better visualization when an operation is pending
- Implement float point calc
- Separate logic for left and right operands
- Memorize values and functions to prevent re-renders



## Known Bugs
- The operation "number times", eg. 9x = 81 is returning 0
- When selecting the right operator, if you type a number of two digits, the highlight operation will be deselected (but clicking on equal button will trigger the operation correctly)
